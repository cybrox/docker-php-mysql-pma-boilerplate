# Docker PHP, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin Boilerplate
Terribly simple boilerplate for dockerizing a typical customer webserver. I put this up mostly to use it as a base for working on my old projects, but feel free to use it however you like.

**Usage:**   
1. Clone this project    
2. Delete .git and paste in all your project content    
3. `docker-compose up`
